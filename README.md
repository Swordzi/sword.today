# Sword.Today Website

This is just a simple website I've been making for myself.
The website is made using [react](https://reactjs.org/) and [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

This is really my first true web project and this repository is going to be updated as I add more features.
Im looking to add a way to implement your own bio website using the stuff I've learned making this one.

## Using the project

To view and modify the code yourself firstly code the repository
with `git clone https://github.com/Swordzi/sword.today.git`
This requires having [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system.
Once you have opened the project in the IDE of your choosing run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies
for this project.
